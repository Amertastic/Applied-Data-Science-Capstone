### Executive Summary

This data science research project aimed to build a machine learning pipeline to predict the success of the first stage landing of SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets. The project involved several stages, including data collection through web scraping and utilizing SpaceX API, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis using various tools such as Folium, Dash, and SQL, model building using four different algorithms, and model evaluation using train-test split and grid search techniques.

The analysis of the data showed that the KSC LC-39A launch site had the highest number of successful launches, and the success rate of launches increased significantly between 2013-2014 and 2015-2017. Moreover, the success rate was higher for orbit types such as ES-L1, GEO, HEO, and SSO. Payload mass and launch site also had an impact on the success rate of the launches.

The models built using logistic regression, support vector machines, decision tree classifier, and k-nearest neighbors had an R^2 error or .score() value of 0.83333. The decision tree model had the highest accuracy score of 0.84214, and it was identified as the best model among the four algorithms analyzed. However, all models had issues with false positives.

Overall, this project suggests that SpaceX's success rate is improving with each launch, and they are continuously learning from their mistakes to improve their rockets. The study also highlights the importance of data analysis in predicting the success of space missions. Further analysis and more data may help improve the accuracy of the predictive models and overcome the false positives issue.

In conclusion, this data science research project provides valuable insights and recommendations for SpaceX and the space industry as a whole to improve the success rate of space missions.

# Overview

For my Capstone project to complete the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, I took on the role of a Data Scientist at a startup aiming to compete with SpaceX. We wanted to determine if the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket would land successfully in order to make more informed bids for rocket launches. 

To achieve this, I followed the Data Science methodology. I collected and wrangled data on previous Falcon 9 launches. I then conducted exploratory data analysis and data visualization to gain key insights from the data. Next, I developed machine learning models using SVM, Classification Trees, K Nearest Neighbors and Logistic Regression to predict if the rocket landing would be successful. I split the data into training and test sets, hyperparameter tuned the models, and evaluated them to determine the best performer. 

My final model using SVM (Support Vector Machines) achieved an accuracy of 84.82% on the test data. I was able to demonstrate key data science and machine learning skills that would be valuable for any employer. This Capstone project is a great addition to my portfolio showing real-world application of data science to a challenging problem.

Through this project, I reinforced my learning from the courses in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate and Specialization. I gained hands-on experience with the end-to-end workflow of a data science project which will be invaluable for my career as a data scientist.

# Project Scenario 

I worked as a data scientist for Space Y, a new rocket company aiming to compete with SpaceX. My job was to determine the cost of each SpaceX Falcon 9 launch to help Space Y price their rockets competitively. 

To do this, I first gathered information about SpaceX and their Falcon 9 rockets. I created data dashboards for my team summarizing details like rocket specifications, launch sites, past missions, and costs. We analyzed the data to determine the major factors impacting the price of a launch. The biggest factor was whether SpaceX chose to reuse the Falcon 9 first stage, which accounts for most of the rocketâ€™s cost. Reusing the first stage could save over $100 million per launch. 

I then trained a machine learning model to predict if SpaceX would reuse the first stage for a given launch based on features like orbit, payload weight, and mission objectives. My model achieved an accuracy of approximately 85% on test data, giving us a good estimate of the launch price. 

By determining the likelihood of first stage reusability and other price drivers, I helped Space Y significantly improve their pricing strategy. My work analyzing SpaceX data and building machine learning models demonstrated my skills in data science and helped Space Y compete in the rapidly growing commercial space industry.

This project allowed me to strengthen my skills in data visualization, machine learning, and solving complex real-world problems. 


### Future Work

Future work could involve collecting more data to improve the model's accuracy and reduce the false positives. It could also be beneficial to explore other machine learning algorithms, such as ensemble methods, to see if they perform better than the current models. Additionally, the model could be updated to include more recent launch data to see if there have been any changes in trends or patterns. Furthermore, it could be interesting to investigate the impact of external factors, such as weather conditions or technical issues, on the success of Falcon 9's first stage landing.
