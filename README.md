# Overview

For my Capstone project to complete the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, I took on the role of a Data Scientist at a startup aiming to compete with SpaceX. We wanted to determine if the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket would land successfully in order to make more informed bids for rocket launches. 

To achieve this, I followed the Data Science methodology. I collected and wrangled data on previous Falcon 9 launches. I then conducted exploratory data analysis and data visualization to gain key insights from the data. Next, I developed machine learning models using SVM, Classification Trees, K Nearest Neighbors and Logistic Regression to predict if the rocket landing would be successful. I split the data into training and test sets, hyperparameter tuned the models, and evaluated them to determine the best performer. 

My final model using SVM (Support Vector Machines) achieved an accuracy of 84.82% on the test data. I was able to demonstrate key data science and machine learning skills that would be valuable for any employer. This Capstone project is a great addition to my portfolio showing real-world application of data science to a challenging problem.

Through this project, I reinforced my learning from the courses in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate and Specialization. I gained hands-on experience with the end-to-end workflow of a data science project which will be invaluable for my career as a data scientist.

# Project Scenario 

The commercial space age is here, companies are making space travel affordable for everyone. Virgin Galactic is providing suborbital spaceflights. Rocket Lab is a small satellite provider. Blue Origin manufactures sub-orbital and orbital reusable rockets. Perhaps the most successful is SpaceX. 

SpaceX’s accomplishments include: Sending spacecraft to the International Space Station. Starlink, a satellite internet constellation providing satellite Internet access. Sending manned missions to Space. One reason SpaceX can do this is the rocket launches are relatively inexpensive. 

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. Spaces X’s Falcon 9 launch like regular rockets. 

To help us understand the scale of the Falcon 9, we are going to use these diagrams from Forest Katsch, at  zlsadesign.com. He is a 3D artist and software engineer. He makes infographics on spaceflight and spacecraft art. He also makes software. The payload is enclosed in the fairings. Stage two, or the second stage, helps bring the payload to orbit, but most of the work is done by the first stage. The first stage is shown here. This stage does most of the work and is much larger than the second stage. Here we see the first stage next to a person and several other landmarks. This stage is quite large and expensive. Unlike other rocket providers, SpaceX's Falcon 9 Can recover the first stage. Sometimes the first stage does not land. Sometimes it will crash as shown in this clip. Other times, Space X will sacrifice the first stage due to the mission parameters like payload, orbit, and customer. 

In this capstone, you will take the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company. Space Y that would like to compete with SpaceX founded by Billionaire industrialist Allon Musk. Your job is to determine the price of each launch. You will do this by gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards for your team. You will also determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, you will train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
